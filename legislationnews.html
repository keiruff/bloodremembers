        Recent legislative efforts regarding reparations in the U.S. include both federal and state-level initiatives. 
        Nationally, H.R. 40 and S. 40 aim to establish a federal commission to study and develop reparations proposals. 
        Washington D.C. has enacted a law to explore reparations for descendants of enslaved and segregated Black Americans. 
        California is advancing a series of bills stemming from the state’s Reparations Task Force findings.

      <h2>Who Has the Power to Enact Reparations?</h2>
      <p>
        Reparations can be enacted at the federal, state, and local levels:
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
        <li><strong>Congress</strong> – Holds the authority to pass national reparations legislation (e.g., H.R. 40, S. 40).</li>
        <li><strong>The President</strong> – Can support reparations efforts but cannot authorize payments without Congress.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Agencies</strong> – May implement programs once legislation is passed by Congress.</li>
        <li><strong>State Legislatures & Governors</strong> – Can create and fund their own reparations initiatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Governments</strong> – Cities can develop reparations policies via local ordinances or budgeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Courts</strong> – Can rule on legal claims but do not have legislative authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>This multi-level responsibility means change can begin anywhere — from Congress to your local city council.</em></p>
