      <p>
        Recent legislative efforts regarding reparations in the U.S. include both federal and state-level initiatives. 
        Nationally, H.R. 40 and S. 40 aim to establish a federal commission to study and develop reparations proposals. 
        Washington D.C. has enacted a law to explore reparations for descendants of enslaved and segregated Black Americans. 
        California is advancing a series of bills stemming from the state‚Äôs Reparations Task Force findings.

      <h2>Who Has the Power to Enact Reparations?</h2>
      <p>
        Reparations can be enacted at the federal, state, and local levels:
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
        <li><strong>Congress</strong> ‚Äì Holds the authority to pass national reparations legislation (e.g., H.R. 40, S. 40).</li>
        <li><strong>The President</strong> ‚Äì Can support reparations efforts but cannot authorize payments without Congress.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Agencies</strong> ‚Äì May implement programs once legislation is passed by Congress.</li>
        <li><strong>State Legislatures & Governors</strong> ‚Äì Can create and fund their own reparations initiatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Governments</strong> ‚Äì Cities can develop reparations policies via local ordinances or budgeting.</li>
        <li><strong>Courts</strong> ‚Äì Can rule on legal claims but do not have legislative authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>This multi-level responsibility means change can begin anywhere ‚Äî from Congress to your local city council.</em></p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-2">Maryland Governor Vetoes Reparations Study</h3>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 16, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Maryland‚Äôs first Black governor, <strong>Wes Moore</strong>, vetoed Senate Bill 587, which would have established a state commission to study reparations for slavery. Although the bill had overwhelming support from lawmakers, Moore argued that ‚Äúnow is not the time for another study,‚Äù stating that the focus should be on direct action such as closing the racial wealth gap and supporting Black-owned businesses.</p>
    <p><strong>Reaction:</strong> The veto drew sharp criticism from members of the Legislative Black Caucus and civil rights leaders, who viewed it as a setback to meaningful reparative justice. Lawmakers have vowed to pursue an override of the governor‚Äôs decision.</p>
