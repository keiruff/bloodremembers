    <h2>How to Trace Freedmen and Black Native Ancestry</h2>
    <p>Many African Americans also descend from Indigenous communities. Here's how to uncover that legacy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with the Dawes Rolls:</strong> Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes were often recorded in separate rolls. Search for family surnames in Freedmen or By Blood categories.</li>
      <li><strong>Use the National Archives:</strong> Explore Bureau of Indian Affairs records, census data, and tribal enrollment applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Research tribal history:</strong> Learn how your family’s geographic location may link to specific tribes like the Cherokee, Choctaw, or Seminole.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Don't let colonial paperwork deny your Indigenous identity. Reclaiming your dual heritage is an act of resistance and truth.</em></p>

    <h2>Reparations 101: What Are We Really Owed?</h2>
    <p>Reparations are not about a handout — they’re about justice. Here's a quick primer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Historical Debt:</strong> Enslaved people were never compensated. Instead, slaveholders were paid for their “loss.”</li>
      <li><strong>Generational Harm:</strong> Redlining, Jim Crow, convict leasing, and mass incarceration widened the racial wealth gap that persists today.</li>
      <li><strong>Global Precedent:</strong> Holocaust survivors, Japanese Americans, and others have received reparations. Why not us?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Reparations are about restoring what was stolen — dignity, land, labor, and legacy.</em></p>

    <h2>Healing Through History: Honoring Our Ancestors</h2>
    <p>Reclaiming history is part of spiritual healing. Here’s how to start:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visit ancestral sites:</strong> Whether it's West African ports, Southern plantations, or Indigenous lands, presence is a powerful tribute.</li>
      <li><strong>Create family archives:</strong> Interview elders, digitize photos, and preserve heirlooms.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice remembrance:</strong> Light a candle. Pour libation. Say their names. Our ancestors are listening.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Healing begins when we remember who we are — and whose we are.</em></p>
