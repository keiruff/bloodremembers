    <p>
      Though slavery was officially abolished over 150 years ago, its legacy persists in deeply entrenched social,
      economic, and institutional disparities. These modern consequences continue to harm African American communities
      across the United States.
    </p>

    <h2>Racial Wealth Gap</h2>
    <p>
      White families have a median wealth over 7 times greater than that of Black families. Generational wealth built
      through homeownership, business equity, and land ownership was systematically denied to African Americans.
    </p>

    <h2>Healthcare Inequities</h2>
    <p>
      Black Americans experience higher rates of chronic illness, lower access to quality care, and maternal mortality
      rates nearly three times higher than their white counterparts. These disparities stem from both economic and
      structural racism.
    </p>

    <h2>Housing Discrimination</h2>
    <p>
      Redlining, predatory lending, and unequal access to home loans have denied Black families the same opportunities
      to build wealth and community stability through housing.
    </p>

    <h2>Mass Incarceration</h2>
    <p>
      Black Americans are incarcerated at five times the rate of whites, despite similar crime rates. The prison
      industrial complex profits from racialized policing and sentencing.
    </p>

    <h2>Underfunded Education</h2>
    <p>
      Predominantly Black schools receive significantly less funding than white counterparts, impacting generations of
      children’s opportunities and outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Understanding these present-day consequences is essential to advocating for justice and reparations.</strong>
