      <p>
        The transatlantic slave trade may have ended over a century ago, but its devastating effects continue to shape Black lives across the globe. This page outlines some of the most persistent systemic consequences rooted in slavery.

      <h2>Racial Wealth Gap</h2>
      <p>
        Centuries of unpaid labor, exclusion from land ownership, and redlining practices have led to a massive racial wealth gap. The average white family's net worth is 6 to 7 times that of the average Black family in the U.S.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Mass Incarceration</h2>
      <p>
        The 13th Amendment abolished slavery “except as punishment for a crime.” Today, Black Americans are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of whites — a continuation of forced labor and control through the prison-industrial complex.

    <section>
      <h2>Education Inequity</h2>
      <p>
        Underfunded schools in predominantly Black neighborhoods, discriminatory discipline practices, and limited access to higher education contribute to cycles of generational disadvantage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Healthcare Disparities</h2>
      <p>
        Black communities face higher rates of chronic illness and lower life expectancy. Systemic racism in healthcare — from inadequate access to biased treatment — exacerbates outcomes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Police Violence</h2>
      <p>
        Over-policing, racial profiling, and excessive use of force are modern echoes of slave patrols. Black Americans are disproportionately stopped, searched, and killed by police.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Housing & Environmental Racism</h2>
      <p>
        From redlining and gentrification to toxic waste facilities near Black neighborhoods, housing discrimination continues to affect where and how Black families live and thrive.
