    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #444; line-height: 1.7;">
      I am a proud descendant of survivors — of stolen ancestors whose names, nations, and stories were nearly erased by slavery and colonization. My DNA tells a powerful story of origin and resilience: I carry blood from <strong>Nigeria</strong> (including Yorubaland), <strong>Benin-Togo</strong>, <strong>Cameroon</strong>, <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Central West Africa</strong>, and the <strong>Southern Bantu</strong peoples.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #444; line-height: 1.7;">
      My journey has also revealed <strong>Portuguese and Brazilian ancestry</strong> connected to regions like <em>Minas Gerais</em> and <em>São Paulo</em>, with echoes of <strong>Sephardic Jewish migration</strong> through Iberian exile and the transatlantic world. I even carry traces of <strong>Northeast Asian</strong> ancestry.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #444; line-height: 1.7;">
      Through DNA matching, I’ve found connections to individuals buried in <strong>Rupert’s Valley</strong> on the remote island of <strong>St. Helena</strong> — victims of the transatlantic slave trade who were captured and detained after British “abolition.” These matches, some over 30%, are proof that my ancestors were among those ripped from their homelands, shipped across oceans, and dumped into forced labor or confinement under colonial control.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #444; line-height: 1.7;">
      I created this space to honor their memory, demand justice, and reclaim truth. My blood remembers — and so does this work.
